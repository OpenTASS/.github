# Welcome to OpenTASS 👋

## OpenTASS is a free software, open-source frontend project for the Alpha School System.

### Our main project is [OpenTASS](github.com/OpenTASS/OpenTASS), a Python library providing API access to TASS using login credentials to fetch data in multiple formats.

This could help with all kinds of scripting and automation, whether it's the unlikely hobby of doing complex data analysis on your timetable or doing something useful like getting a useful notification when you have your next class, event or report. 

### But if you don't want or know how to do any of that...

We have some GUI frontends (user-friendly applications) on the agenda, so stay tuned! These include:
- OpenTASS-Web using Flask!
- OpenTASS-Desktop using PyQt6 (a GUI framework)!
- ...As well as OpenTASS-CLI, using a Python script and the main OpenTASS library!

**Hopefully we can help you *supercharge your school day*, with a bunch of that cool stuff built into all of our projects.**

### What about the project itself?

🙋‍♀️ Hi! We're a bunch of amateur programmers, doing this as a hobby and interest. 
🆓 We are big advocates of the Free Software movement, meaning anyone can see the source code and contribute, making the project better, or freely modify and redistribute copies!
🌈 If you like what we're doing, feel free to help contribute to the project. It can be as simple as submitting an issue, a pull request, or simply starring the projects. Make sure you stick to our guidelines; you'll find them in our repositories.
👩‍💻 People may find the library a bit confusing, we're working on making it a little more... intuitive. Take a look at the docs! They can be found in the wiki pages of the repos.
🍿 If you need help, you can contact us with the email above, and you can always submit an issue if you find something weird.
🧙 We hope these insignificant little projects helps you get a little more productive or really anything of your need!
