# OpenTASS

### The OpenTASS Project aims to provide a Free Software interface to access The Alpha School System (TASS).

## Directory

- [OpenTASS](http://github.com/OpenTASS/OpenTASS) is the main product of the OpenTASS project. It does not provide a useful interface for end-users, but rather allows applications that do so, like GUI interfaces to communicate with TASS. It is in development and already has basic functionality.

- OpenTASS-qt will be a Qt 6 interface for OpenTASS. It has not yet started development.

- OpenTASS-flask will be a Flask interface for OpenTASS. It has not yet started development. 

- OpenTASS-cli will be a command-line interface with basic functionality to interface with TASS. It is currently in very early stages of development, and is yet to be made public.


## Documentation

- Documentation for how your app can use the OpenTASS API will come soon on the various GitHub Wiki pages. 

- If you would like to try any part of OpenTASS, all the features have basic direct interfaces which can be accessed by running each file, like `timetable.py` or `academic-reports.py` and supplying necessary command-line arguments.

- The Developers of OpenTASS offer support in many ways to end-users and other developers. You have three main ways of contacting the Developers or otherwise getting support:
	- You can create an issue on the OpenTASS or OpenTASS-* repositories: [OpenTASS - Issues](https://github.com/OpenTASS/OpenTASS/issues)
	- You can create a Discussion on the OpenTASS or OpenTASS-* repositories: [OpenTASS - Discussions](https://github.com/OpenTASS/OpenTASS/discussions)
	- Alternatively, you can contact the developers via electronic mail using the address: `opentass.inquiries` at `gmail.com` 

## Contributing
- The OpenTASS project is very small with only two Developers, and the Developers do not expect many people to come across the OpenTASS project. The OpenTASS Developers are primarily making the Project for themselves, but of course it is natural to wish for others to use and contribute to the Project.

- Please feel free to create Pull Requests, Issues, or Discussion topics on our repositories.
